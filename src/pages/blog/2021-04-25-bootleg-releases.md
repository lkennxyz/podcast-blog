I have managed to pile up a huge backlog of weeks to edit, all of which require a lot of processing to be editable. So I will be focussing on releasing the backlog as bootleg versions with no background music, no chapter markers, and no cuts for a while so I can turn them around as quickly as possible.

I might come back to them in the future and release the proper versions with all of the lovely edits that make it easier to listen to, but the focus right now is getting back up to date.

Sorry for all the release delays, and I hope you enjoy the great stuff we have coming up.
